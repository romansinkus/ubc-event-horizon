This two-day event will feature game designers, artists, musicians, scholars, and writers, to explore how games act upon us and through us, and how they compel us to take action for ourselves. The conference will examine the social and artistic impacts of video games, much in the same way literature and film are analyzed as influential mediums. Notable speakers include veteran game designer John Romero, designer of Doom, Wolfenstein 3D and Quake, among others. Melos Han-Tani and Marina Kittaka, creators of one of the most highly acclaimed games of the year, Sephonie, and Arthur Protasio, Emmy-nominated director and writer known for his work on the Cobra Kai games, are also panelists.

Sexual and gender-based violence are not individual issues or “private” harms: they are pressing social issues that impact each of us. As the beliefs and structures upholding these forms of violence are deeply embedded in many of our social and cultural norms, histories, and policies, they require our collective efforts to dismantle. To make change that is truly transformative, we must address the systems which engender this violence at their core instead of focusing only on the individuals who act within them. Likewise, we must resist seeing healing from these harms as an exclusively individual task – one where people who experience violence are pressured into prescribed, often inaccessible routes for healing like therapy or reporting and blamed if these aren’t helpful to them. Instead, we must work together to understand the systemic nature of harm and reimagine healing collectively. Everyone who experiences harm deserves to choose what healing and justice look like to them. While we must center the needs of the person who experienced the harm directly, all those who have been impacted deserve healing as well, including those who know and care about people who have caused, witnessed, or experienced harm. This requires us to work collectively to ensure that existing routes to healing are made accessible, while spaces for communal care and new visions of healing and justice are equally cultivated. Though experiencing or being impacted by violence can feel profoundly isolating, we are not alone. As communities and individuals, we can be healed in the acts of both building and accessing communal networks of support, acting in solidarity to challenge the cultural myths and structures that uphold violence, and fostering an ethic of accountability in our relationships, communities, and institutions. Join the @ams.sasc.ubc and UBC SVPRO for Sexual Assault Awareness Month (SAAM) as we dedicate this year to healing harm through community.",ubc.svpro

Cerebral palsy is a neurological disorder that affects movement and posture. It is caused by brain damage that occurs during pregnancy, childbirth, or early childhood. The symptoms and severity of cerebral palsy can vary widely depending on the individual, but common red flags include delayed developmental milestones, abnormal muscle tone, poor coordination, abnormal reflexes, unusual posture, vision or hearing problems, and seizures. Early diagnosis and intervention can improve outcomes and quality of life for individuals with cerebral palsy. if you wish to learn more, check out a VeRy InTeRestinG peer-reviewed scholarly journal article below: ?? The study examined the effects of Nintendo Wii-Fit® video games on balance, muscle strength, and motor function in children with mild cerebral palsy. The results showed that the children who participated in Wii-Fit® games demonstrated significant improvements in these areas compared to the control group. The study suggests that using Wii-Fit® games as a form of therapy can be a safe, effective, and enjoyable way to improve the functional abilities of children with cerebral palsy. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings. __________________________ References: ?? Tarakci, D., Ersoz Huseyinsinoglu, B., Tarakci, E., & Razak Ozdincler, A. (2016).

We are once again back with another Spinal Cord Fact ???? What is ?????????? ????????????? Spina bifida (SB) is one of the most common childhood disabilities. It is a birth defect that affects the spine due to a neural tube defect (NTD) with incomplete closure and can occur anywhere along the spine if the neural tube does not close all the way. When this occurs, the vertebra that protects the spinal cord does not form and close properly, resulting in damage to the spinal cord and nerves. It has been associated with increased mortality and disability and may require lifelong medical care. Each year, approximately 1427 babies are born with SB in the United States, or 1 in every 2758 live births, although the incidence has decreased over the last several decades. This reduction can be attributed to folic acid supplementation and early detection. SB may range from mild to severe, with no resulting disabilities to significant impairments, depending on the extent and location of the defect. _________________________________ Check out our reference: ??
