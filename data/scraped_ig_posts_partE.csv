By now many of you may have heard the news about Meta and Bill C-18. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has made the decision to block all news sources in Canada on its platforms. Unfortunately, that also includes non-profit radio, aka your favorite campus radio station CiTR101.9FM (at least we hope your fave is us ??) If you're able to see this post please share a screenshot of the post to your story !! ???? Why is this happening? This is the result of a battle between the Canadian government and tech giants Meta & Google over the Online News Act (Bill C-18). The bill was passed back in June and required digital companies to share revenue with Canadian news organizations by paying them anytime someone reached a webstory through a link on their platforms. Meta has recently fired back by saying it will just block Canadian news off its platforms. Not-For-Profit Radio was included in the bill and according to the National Campus & Community Radio Association (NCRA), Meta has refused to meet with Campus/Community Radio associations. For more information on the situation and how it affects campus radio, please head to the NCRA’s website. (https://ncra.ca/banned/) So what’s our plan? Firstly, we urge everyone to follow us on Twitter (@CiTRradio) and join our Discord server (https://discord.com/invite/pfTxfnAy2G). Our Discord server allows communication between members and different departments, and we also post any announcements. Secondly, we are hoping to post updates about CiTR & Discorder and our events on the Fanta Records Instagram page (our Record Label). Please follow @fantarecords for more updates and fingers crossed the page stays up. We are going to be experimenting and seeing what kind of content we can keep posting without being flagged. As we have our Victory Square Block Party event coming up (Sept. 3rd) and Shindig coming up in the fall, we will continue to post our event promo and updates on that account. We will try and keep everyone updated on the situation as we figure things out. In the meantime, stay tuned and stay reading with CiTR & Discorder. We love you all! mWAH! ??",citranddiscorder

With the signing of the Paris Climate Accord, most of the world’s governments agreed that we’d need to slash fossil fuel emissions in half to reach net zero by 2050. Net zero is the point of equilibrium between the greenhouse gas we produce and what’s removed from the atmosphere by forest and ocean carbon sinks. Clean energy technologies such as solar panels, improved batteries and fuel cells offered hope in reducing emissions, but the Paris Agreement made clear that there was massive gap in getting affordable new products to market. Materials discovery is a major part of the innovation cycle of clean energy technology, but developing commercially viable materials typically takes over a decade. That technological shortfall sparked Mission Innovation, a global initiative launched in 2017 to find ways to break the research and development bottleneck. Mission Innovation issued a call to action — combine materials science with automation and artificial intelligence to accelerate materials discovery by at least ten-fold. Canada was the first to answer this call with the launch of Project Ada, a University of British Columbia-led initiative that positioned the nation as a world leader in self-driving labs. In 2018, an $8 million Natural Resources Canada grant enabled UBC professors Dr. Curtis Berlinguette and Dr. Jason Hein, along with Dr. Alán Aspuru-Guzik of the University of Toronto, to assemble “Ada”, the first self-driving lab for clean energy materials. The multidisciplinary team chose the name in honour of Ada Lovelace, the world’s first computer programmer. Self-driving labs like Ada think for and work by themselves, combining automation with machine learning to plan, conduct and analyze experiments much faster than humans can. @cpb_cleanenergy @ubcchem @mirusmarttech #selfdrivinglabs #AI #robotics #chemistry #cleanenergy See Linktree in our bio to learn more or go to bit.ly/ai-chem-lab",ubcscience

They can squeeze into incredibly small spaces to get nectar and hit flight speeds as high as 9Gs while courting without getting physically hurt. They also appear to have very controlled methods of flight. Hummingbirds use two distinct sensory strategies to control how they fly, depending on whether they are moving forward or hovering. The findings are described in a study published January 10 in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. When flying forward, hummingbirds rely on an “internal forward model.” This model is an ingrained and intuitive autopilot that allows them to gauge speed while experiencing multiple visual stimuli. “There’s just too much information coming in to rely directly on every visual cue from your surroundings,” study co-author and @ZoologyUBC prof Dr. Vikram B. Baliga said. However, when the birds are hovering or handling cues that may require them to change their altitude, the team found that they use more real-time, direct visuals from their environment. To study these flight patterns, the team brought 11 wild adult male Anna’s hummingbirds (Calypte anna) into the lab. They prompted the birds to repeatedly fly from a perch to a feeder in a tunnel about 13 feet long and recorded videos of each flight. The team also projected patterns on the front and side walls of the tunnel to test how the hummingbirds reacted to this variety of visual stimuli. “If the birds were taking their cues directly from visual stimuli, we’d expect them to adjust their forward velocity to the speed of vertical stripes on the side walls,” said Baliga. “But while the birds did change velocity or stop altogether depending on the patterns, there wasn’t a neat correlation.” The findings provide insight on how these speedy birds perceive the world when they transition their flight patterns. Data like this could also help engineers develop better onboard navigation systems for drones and hovering vehicles in the future.",ubcscience
