As such, the ASA executive team has decided to cancel the Arabian Nights Gala. The team has spent a lot of time and effort on this event, and we were excited to bring together the Arab community through a large celebration of our culture. While we won't be able to do this for the time being, we hope we can continue to build a strong community at UBC and in the broader Vancouver area now and in the future. We would like to recognize the contributions of all of our members, our sponsors, our performers, and our non-exec event planners who generously volunteered their time to this event. Without them, an event of this magnitude would never have been a possibility. We hope that despite the cancellation this year, ASA teams in the future can use the relationships we've built for a similar event in the coming years. Everyone who bought a ticket will be reimbursed. If you purchased a ticket through Showpass, we will reimburse you through their site automatically. If you purchased a ticket from our booth, we will message you or you can reach out to us for reimbursement.
