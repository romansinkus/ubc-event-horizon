## Description
Did you know about the upcoming Yoga Rave? Or about the upcoming Science Olympics? There are constantly exciting events happening at UBC, but if you're like many students, keeping track of them all can be overwhelming. According to our survey, only 1% of UBC students are always able to keep up with events going on. With over 650 official AMS clubs, 26 departments, and dozens of student services, that's no surprise. But what if there was a way to always stay in the loop effortlessly?

Introducing Event Horizon â€“ your centralized hub for all events at UBC. No more need to keep up with dozens of instagram accounts and multiple other websites. Our mission is not just about convenience; it's about fostering a vibrant, interconnected community on campus. From academic seminars, networking events, athletic competitions, and even a yoga rave, by bringing these events into one accessible platform, we're making it easier than ever for students to find their communities and engage in meaningful experiences.
